## 🏗️ Architecture: The Fundamental Difference

### Vercel: Serverless / Edge Computing

**How It Works**:
```
User Request → Edge Function (runs for that request only) → Response
```

**Characteristics**:
- ⚡ **Instant cold starts** (milliseconds)
- 🌍 **Global edge network** (300+ locations)
- ⏱️ **Time-limited** (10s free, 60s Pro)
- 📦 **Stateless** (no memory between requests)
- 💾 **Read-only filesystem**
- 🚫 **No background processes**

**Perfect For**:
- API endpoints that respond instantly
- Static site generation
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Edge computing

**Example**:
```python
# This works on Vercel
@app.route('/api/hello')
def hello():
    return jsonify({"message": "Hello!"})
```

**This DOESN'T work**:
```python
# ❌ Vercel - Background thread fails
thread = threading.Thread(target=long_running_task)
thread.start()

# ❌ Vercel - SQLite can't write
db = sqlite3.connect('database.db')

# ❌ Vercel - File writes fail
with open('data.json', 'w') as f:
    f.write('data')
```

### Railway: Traditional Cloud Hosting

**How It Works**:
```
User Request → Long-Running Server (always on) → Response
```

**Characteristics**:
- 🔄 **Always running** (24/7 server)
- 💾 **Persistent filesystem** (SQLite works)
- 🧵 **Background threads** work
- ⏰ **Cron jobs** work natively
- 🗄️ **Databases** integrated
- 🔌 **WebSockets** supported

**Perfect For**:
- Flask/Django/Express apps
- Apps with SQLite or PostgreSQL
- Background tasks
- Scheduled jobs
- WebSocket servers
- **Your TORQ Tech News app** ⭐

**Example**:
```python
# ✅ Railway - Everything works!
thread = threading.Thread(target=auto_update_content)
thread.start()

db = sqlite3.connect('analytics.db')
db.execute('INSERT INTO visitors...')

with open('data_cache.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
```
