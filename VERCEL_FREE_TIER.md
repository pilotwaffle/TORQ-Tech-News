# Vercel Free Tier Limitations & Solutions

## 🚨 Issue: Cron Job Restriction

**Error**: "Hobby accounts are limited to daily cron jobs"

**What This Means**:
- Vercel Free (Hobby) plan: **1 cron job per day maximum**
- Our original config: 2 runs per day (6 AM & 11 PM)
- Result: Deployment blocked

---

## ✅ Solution 1: Single Daily Cron Job (IMPLEMENTED)

**Updated Configuration**: `vercel.json`

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/update-content",
      "schedule": "0 6 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Runs once daily at 6:00 AM UTC
- ✅ Free tier compatible
- ✅ Automatic content updates

**To change the time**, use cron syntax:
- `0 6 * * *` = 6 AM UTC daily
- `0 12 * * *` = 12 PM UTC daily
- `0 18 * * *` = 6 PM UTC daily
- `0 0 * * *` = Midnight UTC daily

## ✅ Solution 2: Manual Updates

You can manually trigger updates anytime by visiting:

```
https://torq-tech-news.vercel.app/api/manual-update
```

**Use Cases**:
- Want fresh content immediately
- Testing the automation
- Special updates outside cron schedule

---

## ✅ Solution 3: Upgrade to Vercel Pro ($20/month)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Multiple daily cron jobs (our 6 AM & 11 PM schedule)
- ✅ Custom domains
- ✅ Advanced analytics
- ✅ Password protection
- ✅ Better performance

**If you upgrade**, change `vercel.json` back to:
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/update-content",
      "schedule": "0 6,23 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🏆 Solution 4: Railway for 24/7 Automation (RECOMMENDED)

**Best of Both Worlds**:
- **Railway** ($5/month): Run automation 24/7 with background scheduler
- **Vercel** (Free): Serve the website

### Railway Advantages:
- ✅ **True 24/7** background process
- ✅ Run cron at **6 AM AND 11 PM** (or any schedule)
- ✅ **$5/month** (cheaper than Vercel Pro)
- ✅ SQLite database persists
- ✅ Full control over scheduling

### How It Works:
1. **Deploy to Railway**: Runs the automation agent 24/7
2. **Deploy to Vercel**: Serves the website globally
3. **Connect them**: Railway updates content, Vercel displays it

**Setup**:
1. Deploy to Railway: https://railway.app/new
2. Railway runs `app.py` with background scheduler
3. Content updates at 6 AM & 11 PM automatically
4. Database persists between updates
