      "full_text": "As it turns out they don't actually want you to do this (and have some interesting ways to stop you)\n\nTL;DR\n\nI bought my first ebook from amazon\n\nAmazon's Kindle Android app was really buggy and crashed a bunch\n\nTried to download my book to use with a functioning reader app\n\nRealized Amazon no longer lets you do that\n\nDecided to reverse engineer their obfuscation system out of spite\n\nDiscovered multiple layers of protection including randomized alphabets\n\nDefeated all of them with font matching wizardry\n\nPart 1: Amazon Made This Personal\n\nThe One Time I Tried To Do Things The Right Way\n\nI've been \"obtaining\" ebooks for years. But this ONE time, I thought: \"Let's support the author.\"\n\nDownload Kindle app on Android. Open book.\n\nCrash.\n\nI Just Wanted To Read My Book\n\nApp crashes. Fine, I'll use the web reader.\n\nOh wait, can't download it for offline reading. What if I'm on a plane?\n\nHold on, I can't even export it to Calibre? Where I keep ALL my other books?\n\nSo let me get this straight:\n\nI paid money for this book\n\nI can only read it in Amazon's broken app\n\nI can't download it\n\nI can't back it up\n\nI don't actually own it\n\nAmazon can delete it whenever they want\n\nThis is a rental, not a purchase.\n\nThis does not say \"Rent\"\n\nIt Becomes Personal\n\nI could've refunded and \"obtained\" it in 30 seconds. Would've been easier.\n\nBut that's not the point.\n\nThe point is I PAID FOR THIS BOOK. It's mine. And I'm going to read it in Calibre with the rest of my library even if I have to reverse engineer their web client to do it.\n\nReversal Time\n\nKindle Cloud Reader (the web version) actually works. While looking through the network requests, I spotted this:\n\nhttps://read.amazon.com/renderer/render\n\nTo download anything, you need:\n\n1. Session cookies - standard Amazon login\n\n2. Rendering token - from the startReading API call\n\n3. ADP session token - extra auth layer\n\nSending the same headers and cookies the browser does returns a TAR file.\n\nWhat's Inside The TAR?\n\npage_data_0_4.json # The \"text\" (spoiler: it's not text) glyphs.json # SVG definitions for every character toc.json # Table of contents metadata.json # Book info location_map.json # Position mappings\n\nPart 3: Amazon's Obfuscation Layers of Ebook Hell\n\nDownloaded the first few pages, expected to see text. Got this instead:\n\n{ \"type\": \"TextRun\", \"glyphs\": [24, 25, 74, 123, 91, 18, 19, 30, 4, ...], \"style\": \"paragraph\" }\n\nThese aren't letters. They're glyph IDs. Character 'T' isn't Unicode 84, it's glyph 24.\n\nAnd glyph 24 is just a series of numbers that define a stroke path, its just an image of a letter.\n\nIt's a substitution cipher! Each character maps to a non-sequential glyph ID.\n\nThe Alphabet Changes Every. Five. Pages.\n\nDownloaded the next batch of pages. Same letter 'T' is now glyph 87.\n\nNext batch? Glyph 142.\n\nThey randomize the entire alphabet on EVERY request.\n\nThis means:\n\nYou can only get 5 pages at a time (API hard limit)\n\nEach request gets completely new glyph mappings\n\nGlyph IDs are meaningless across requests\n\nYou can't build one mapping table for the whole book\n\nLet Me Show You How Bad This Is\n\nFor my 920-page book:\n\n184 separate API requests needed\n\nneeded 184 different random alphabets to crack\n\nto crack 361 unique glyphs discovered (a-z, A-Z, punctuation, ligatures)\n\ndiscovered (a-z, A-Z, punctuation, ligatures) 1,051,745 total glyphs to decode\n\nFake Font Hints (They're Getting Sneaky)\n\nSome SVG paths contained this garbage:\n\nM695.068,0 L697.51,-27.954 m3,1 m1,6 m-4,-7 L699.951,-55.908 ...\n\nLooking at it, we see these tiny m3,1 m1,6 m-4,-7 commands, they are micro MoveTo operations.\n\nWhy this is evil:\n\nBrowsers handle them fine (native Path2D)\n\nPython SVG libraries create spurious connecting lines\n\nMakes glyphs look corrupted when rendered naively\n\nBreaks path-sampling approaches\n\nThis is deliberate anti-scraping. The glyphs render perfectly in browser but make it so we cant just compare paths in our parser.\n\nTake a look\n\nFun!\n\nEventually I figured out that filling in the complete path mitigated this.\n\nMultiple Font Variants\n\nNot just one font. FOUR variants:\n\nbookerly_normal (99% of glyphs)\n\nbookerly_italic (emphasis)\n\nbookerly_bold (headings)\n\nbookerly_bolditalic (emphasized headings)\n\nPlus special ligatures: ff, fi, fl, ffi, ffl\n\nMore variations = more unique glyphs to crack = more pain.\n\nOCR Is Mid (My Failed Attempt)\n\nTried running OCR on rendered glyphs. Results:\n\n178/348 glyphs recognized (51%)\n\n170 glyphs failed completely\n\nOCR just sucks at single characters without context. Confused 'l' with 'I' with '1'. Couldn't handle punctuation. Gave up on ligatures entirely.\n\nOCR probably need words and sentences to work well.\n\nPart 4: The Solution That Actually Worked\n\nEvery request includes `glyphs.json` with SVG path definitions:\n\n{ \"24\": { \"path\": \"M 450 1480 L 820 1480 L 820 0 L 1050 0 L 1050 1480 ...\", \"fontFamily\": \"bookerly_normal\" }, \"87\": { \"path\": \"M 450 1480 L 820 1480 L 820 0 L 1050 0 L 1050 1480 ...\", \"fontFamily\": \"bookerly_normal\" } }\n\nGlyph IDs change, but SVG shapes don't.\n\nWhy Direct SVG Comparison Failed\n\nFirst attempt: normalize and compare SVG path coordinates.\n\nFailed because:\n\nCoordinates vary slightly\n\nPath commands represented differently\n\nPixel-Perfect Matching\n\nScrew coordinate comparison. Let's just render everything and compare pixels.\n\nRender that A\n\n1. Render every SVG as an image\n\nUse cairosvg (lets us handle those fake font hints correctly)\n\nRender at 512 x 512px for accuracy\n\n2. Generate perceptual hashes\n\nHash each rendered image\n\nThe hash becomes the unique identifier\n\nSame shape = same hash, regardless of glyph ID\n\n3. Build normalized glyph space\n\nMap all 184 random alphabets to hash-based IDs\n\nNow glyph \"a1b2c3d4...\" always means letter 'T'\n\n4. Match to actual characters\n\nDownload Bookerly TTF fonts\n\nRender every character (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, punctuation)\n\nUse SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) to match\n\nWhy SSIM Is Perfect For This\n\nSSIM compares image structure, not pixels directly. It handles:\n\nSlight rendering differences\n\nAnti-aliasing variations\n\nMinor scaling issues\n\nFor each unknown glyph, find the TTF character with highest SSIM score. That's your letter.\n\nHandling The Edge Cases\n\nLigatures: ff, fi, fl, ffi, ffl\n\nThese are single glyphs for multiple characters\n\nHad to add them to TTF library manually\n\nSpecial characters: em-dash, quotes, bullets\n\nExtended character set beyond basic ASCII\n\nMatched against full Unicode range in Bookerly\n\nFont variants: Bold, italic, bold-italic\n\nBuilt separate libraries for each variant\n\nMatch against all libraries, pick best score\n\nPart 5: The Moment It All Worked\n\nFinal Statistics\n\n=== NORMALIZATION PHASE === Total batches processed: 184 Unique glyphs found: 361 Total glyphs in book: 1,051,745 === MATCHING PHASE === Successfully matched 361/361 unique glyphs (100.00%) Failed to match: 0 glyphs Average SSIM score: 0.9527 === DECODED OUTPUT === Total characters: 5,623,847 Pages: 920\n\nPerfect. Every single character decoded correctly.\n\nEPUB Reconstruction With Perfect Formatting\n\nThe JSON includes positioning for every text run:\n\n{ \"glyphs\": [24, 25, 74], \"rect\": {\"left\": 100, \"top\": 200, \"right\": 850, \"bottom\": 220}, \"fontStyle\": \"italic\", \"fontWeight\": 700, \"fontSize\": 12.5, \"link\": {\"positionId\": 7539} }\n\nI used this to preserve:\n\nParagraph breaks (Y-coordinate changes)\n\nText alignment (X-coordinate patterns)\n\nBold/italic styling\n\nFont sizes\n\nInternal links\n\nThe final EPUB is near indistinguishable from the original!\n\nThe Real Conclusion\n\nAmazon put real effort into their web obfuscation.\n\nWas It Worth It?\n\nTo read one book? No.\n\nTo prove a point? Absolutely.\n\nTo learn about SVG rendering, perceptual hashing, and font metrics? Probably yes.\n\nUse This Knowledge Responsibly\n\nThis is for backing up books YOU PURCHASED.\n\nDon't get me sued into oblivion thanks.",
