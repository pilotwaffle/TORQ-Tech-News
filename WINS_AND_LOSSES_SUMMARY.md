```

- All future Hacker News articles will be clickable
- Prevents 404s on article detail pages

---

## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES (Not Breaking)

### 1. **3 Topic Pages Have No Articles**

| Topic | Status | Issue |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Innovation | ✅ Loads | No articles matching "Innovation" category |
| Sustainability | ✅ Loads | No articles matching "Sustainability" category |
| Operations | ✅ Loads | No articles matching "Operations" category |

**Why This Happens:**
- Current articles in data_cache.json don't have these exact category values
- The topic filtering looks for category matches
- Pages load correctly and show "No Articles Found" message

**User Impact:** Low - pages work, just need content
**Solution Options:**
1. Wait for auto-update to fetch more articles (happens every 5 hours)
2. Increase MIT Sloan article limit from 6 to 12 in aggregator
3. Add fallback to search titles/excerpts (partially implemented)

---

### 2. **Homepage Article Cards Detection**

**Status:** Unknown (not clearly detected in automated test)
**Expected:** 7-9 article cards on homepage
**Reality:** Likely working, but need manual verification

**Impact:** Low - article cards on topic pages work perfectly
**Action Needed:** Manual check to verify homepage cards are clickable
